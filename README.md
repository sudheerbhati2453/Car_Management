#Smart Cab Allocation System for Efficient Trip Planning

Overview
This project is a Smart Cab Allocation System designed to optimize cab management, tracking, and booking using C++. It focuses on providing an efficient solution to allocate cabs to users based on their proximity to the trip start location, ensuring minimal travel distance and time. The system also incorporates real-time cab tracking, fault-tolerant mechanisms, and scalable algorithms for smooth and fast operation.

Key Features:
Cab Allocation Optimization: Efficiently suggests the nearest available cab based on real-time location data.
Cab Management: Track the current status (engaged or available) and location of all cabs in the system.
Employee Cab Search: Provides an optimized interface for employees to find nearby cabs currently in use.
Fault Tolerance: Handles potential system failures and ensures data consistency using backup and recovery strategies.
Real-time Tracking: Seamlessly integrates real-time location data for accurate cab allocation and trip planning.
Project Structure
Core Modules:
Cab Allocation Optimization:
The algorithm selects the best cab by calculating the distance from the trip's starting point and assigns it based on availability.
Cab Management:
Real-time tracking of all cabs, storing their location, status (engaged or available), and ID.
Booking System:
Employees can search for nearby cabs that are currently engaged, providing them with fast and efficient booking recommendations.
Technologies Used:
C++: The core of this project is written in C++ to ensure high performance and low-level control over memory usage.
Object-Oriented Programming: The system follows OOP principles for modular and maintainable code, allowing easy scalability.
Data Structures: Efficient data structures are used to manage real-time cab data and perform fast lookups for allocation.
Real-Time Tracking: The system supports real-time location updates, enabling accurate cab suggestions based on the current position.
How to Run the Project
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/smart-cab-allocation-system.git
cd smart-cab-allocation-system
Compile the Code: To compile the project, you can use any C++ compiler like g++. If you're using a terminal, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
g++ main.cpp -o cab_system
Run the Program: After compiling, you can run the program using the following command:

bash
Copy code
./cab_system
Sample Test: You can test the system with sample input data for cabs (latitude, longitude, and status) and trip start location. The system will output the nearest available cab.
